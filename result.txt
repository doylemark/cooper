ABSTRACT = {To provide various applications in various domains, a large-scale cloud data center is required. Cloud computing enables access to nearly infinite computing resources on demand. As cloud computing grows in popularity, researchers in this field must conduct real-world experiments. Configuring and running these tests in an actual cloud environment is costly. Modeling and simulation methods, on the other hand, are acceptable solutions for emulating environments in cloud computing. This research paper reviewed several simulation tools specifically for cloud computing in the literature and presented the most effective simulation methods in this research domain, as well as an analysis of a variety of cloud simulation tools. Cloud computing tools such as CloudSim, CloudSim Plus, CloudAnalyst, iFogSim, and CloudReports were evaluated. Furthermore, a parametric evaluation of cloud simulation tools is presented based on the identified parameters. Several 5-parameter tests were performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the cloud simulator. These results show the value of our proposed simulation system. CloudSim, CloudSim Plus, CloudAnalyst, iFogSim, and CloudReports are used to evaluate host processing elements, virtual machine processing elements, cloudlet processing elements, userbase average, minimum, and maximum, and cloudlet ID Start Time, Finish Time, Average Start, and Average Finish for each simulator. The outcomes compare these five simulator metrics. After reading this paper, the reader will be able to compare popular simulators in terms of supported models, architecture, and high-level features. We performed a comparative analysis of several cloud simulators based on various parameters. The goal is to provide insights for each analysis given their features, functionalities, and guidelines on the way to researchers’ preferred tools.},
